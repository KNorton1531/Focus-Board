        <h3>General</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 1.7;">This app is a very much work in progress. It will not work on mobile as the intention of this app doesn't suit that platform. It will not be ready for some time but features are being added all the time. It is primarily for my own personal use but feel free to use this. Be warned it is very unstable. When it is more stable, the domain will change and will be displayed here.</p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.7;">IMPORTANT: The spotify app is in development mode and I can't do anything about that yet. If you want to have your account added to the app, email me your spotify email to dexterandkyle@live.co.uk and I will add you. Without this you will not be able to link your account.</p>
